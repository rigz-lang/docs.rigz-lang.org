# Introduction

rigz is a dynamic scripting language written in Rust, it's heavily inspired by Ruby, Kotlin, and Rust; the best way to start using it is by installing it with cargo or you can try it using the [online repl](//repl.rigz-lang.org).

    cargo install rigz

For now there are no pre-built binaries and rigz must be built from source, if you need how to install rust you can follow this [guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
